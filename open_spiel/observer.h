#ifndef OPEN_SPIEL_OBSERVER_H_

// This class is the primary method for getting observations from games.
// Each Game object has a MakeObserver() method which returns an Observer
// object given a specification of the required observation type.

// To access observation from C++, first initialize an observer and observation
// for the game (one time only).
//
//    auto observer = game->MakeObserver(iig_obs_type, params);
//    Observation observation(*game, observer);
//
// Then for states in a trajectory, get a tensor observation using:
//
//    observation.SetFrom(state, player);   // populates observation.Tensor()
//
// The resultant tensor is accessible from observation.Tensor(). Note that
// the decomposition of the tensor into named pieces is not currently available
// through this API (it is available in Python).
//
// To obtain a string observation:
//
//    std::string string_obs = observation.StringFrom(state, player);
//
// Access from Python follows a similar pattern, with the addition of support
// for accessing pieces of the observation tensor by name. See `observation.py`
// and `observation_test.py`.

  kAllPlayers     // Private information for all players.
};

// Observation types for imperfect-information games.

// The public / private observations factorize observations into their
// (mostly) non-overlapping public and private parts. They may overlap only for
// the start of the game and time.
//
// The public observations correspond to information that all the players know
// that all the players know, like upward-facing cards on a table.
// Perfect information games, like Chess, have only public observations.
//
// All games have non-empty public observations. The minimum public
// information is time: we assume that all the players can perceive absolute
// time (which can be accessed via the MoveNumber() method). The implemented
// games must be 1-timeable, a property that is trivially satisfied with all
// human-played board games, so you typically don't have to worry about this.
// (You'd have to knock players out / consider Einstein's time-relativistic
// effects to make non-timeable games.).
//
// The public observations are used to create a sequence of observations:
// a public observation history. Because of the sequential structure, when you
// return any non-empty public observation, you implicitly encode time as well
// within this sequence.
//
// Public observations are not required to be "common knowledge" observations.
// Example: In imperfect-info version of card game Goofspiel, players make
// bets with cards on their hand, and their imperfect information consists of
// not knowing exactly what cards the opponent currently holds, as the players
// only learn public information whether they have won/lost/draw the bet.
// However, when the player bets a card "5" and learns it drew the round,
// it can infer that the opponent must have also bet the card "5", just as the
// player did. In principle we could ask the game to make this inference
// automatically, and return observation "draw-5". We do not require this, as
// it is in general expensive to compute. Returning public observation "draw"
// is sufficient.

// The private observations correspond to the part of the observation that
// is not public. In Poker, this would be the cards the player holds in his
// hand. Note that this does not imply that other players don't have access
// to this information.
//
// For example, consider there is a mirror behind an unaware player, betraying
// his hand in the reflection. Even if everyone was aware of the mirror, then
// this information still may not be public, because the players do not know
// for certain that everyone is aware of this. It would become public if and
// only if all the players were aware of the mirror, and they also knew that
// indeed everyone else knows about it too. Then this would effectively make
// it the same as if the player just placed his cards on the table for
// everyone to see.
//
// If there is no private observation available, the implementation should
// return an empty string.
